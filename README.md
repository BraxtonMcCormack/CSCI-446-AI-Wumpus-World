# CSCI-446-AI-Wumpus-World

## Project Overview:
This project implements a First-Order Logic (FOL) system to solve the "Wumpus World" problem, a classic AI problem where an agent must navigate a grid while avoiding hazards like pits and a lurking Wumpus.

## How to Run:
To run the project, simply execute `main.py`.

## Key Components:
- **First-Order Logic (FOL)**: The system uses FOL to make inferences based on the agentâ€™s observations about the environment, such as detecting hazards, finding the Wumpus, and determining safe moves.

## Problem Statement:
The Wumpus World problem involves using logical reasoning to explore a dangerous world and reach the goal while avoiding pits and the Wumpus.

## Usage:
The agent navigates the grid based on FOL rules and makes decisions to avoid danger and find the goal.
